# HotelBooker

This project was developed as part of a university course at ORT University in Uruguay. The project is built using CSS, JS, and HTML and is designed to provide a hotel reservation system with administrative capabilities.

The system provides a user-friendly interface for hotel administrators and customers.

For a detailed description of the project and its features, please refer to the project report in the file Obligatorio P1 M.Perez 294829.pdf. The report explains the purpose of each button, the different user roles, and the testing performed on the system. (Please note that the document is in Spanish, as it was part of the project requirements) 

This project was developed entirely by Martin Perez.
